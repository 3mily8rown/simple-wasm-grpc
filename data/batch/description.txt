time 100 batches of 10
time 10 batches of 100
to see difference

1. latency per batch
2. throughput per request

discussion 
* of batch complexity
* the lack of streams?
* could have server that decodes batch then could distribute individual between servers and respond individually


repeat in:
* colocated
* not colocated
* baseline

* same vm?
* i dont think grpc has the same kind of batching so could just discuss it
