1. time from send first message to receive last message - i suppose repeat a couple times
2. from that can calculate throuput

3. could try adding second server and seeing speed up - for simplicity have the servers on the same host so no port mess

4. cpu rss like in sync



for sync i sent 10,000 messages so should do that again for consistency


do this stuff for:
* colocated
* not colocated
* baseline

* same container?
* grpc? - they have an async client so could give myself 45 min max to have a go?
